# Rogueskiv

### ⚠️ Work in progress: This is a proof of concept, not a fully developed game.

Rogueskiv is a mashup of [Eskiv](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22eskiv%22&t=ffab&ia=web) (by jf) and the countless [Roguelike games](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/), inspired by the [Roguelike Celebration 2018](https://roguelike.club/event2018.html) talk: [Pippin Barr + Jonathan Lessard: Chess + Rogue = Chogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1YEJBKehAY).
